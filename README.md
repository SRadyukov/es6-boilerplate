## es6-boilerplate

ES6 Boilerplate allows you to use features from the next version of javascript (es6) today, and transpile them to the
current version of javascript (es5) so they run in all browsers.  ES6 modules, AMD modules and global scripts
and libraries all work together, and can be easily built, concatentated, minified, and gzipped along with source
maps to allow you to debug in production while delivering high performance to your users.

ES6 Boilerplate is based off of Vojta JÃ­na's fantastic es6-playground project, which he says is the same his team
at google is using to develop AngularJS version 2.0.


### Initial setup

```bash
# Clone the repo...
git clone https://github.com/davidjnelson/es6-boilerplate.git
cd es6-boilerplate
```

# Then, you need to install all the dependencies...
```bash
npm install
bower install
```

### Running the tests
```bash
karma start
```

### Running in the browser
```bash
gulp build
gulp serve
```

# If you want Gulp to re-build on every change...
```bash
gulp watch
```

### How to load legacy libraries and code from amd modules or from browser globals?
If you have an amd or browser global module, add it to src/runtime-config.js under the paths object.  If it needs to
export a global, add it to the shim object, specifying the module name and the global name it exports.  Whether it's
an amd module or a shimmed browser global, add it to the require call at the bottom of runtime-config.js so that
the build process sees it and concatenates it.

In the following example, the traceur runtime exports a global through the shim, and jquery is loaded as an amd module:
```js
require.config({
    // put both amd and browser global modules here
    paths: {
        assert: '../node_modules/rtts-assert/dist/amd/assert',
        traceur: '../bower_components/traceur-runtime/traceur-runtime',
        jquery: '../bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery'
    },
    // put any browser global modules here
    shim: {
        'traceur': {
            exports: '$traceurRuntime'
        }
    }
});

// put amd and browser global modules here so that the requirejs optimizer knows to concatenate them
require(['traceur', 'jquery'], function() {

});
```

### How to use es6 modules?
To use es6 modules, simple add new files anywhere under the src directory.  The syntax for exporting a module looks like this:

```js
class Person {
    constructor(firstName, lastName) {
        this.firstName = firstName;
        this.lastName = lastName;
    }

    get fullName() {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
}
export {Person}
```

And the syntax for importing a module looks like this:

```js
import {Person} from '../../src/model/Person'

var person;

describe('Person', function() {
    beforeEach(function() {
        person = new Person('firstName', 'lastName');
    });

    it('should return the first and last name', function() {
        expect(person.fullName).toEqual('firstName lastName');
    })
});
```

### Where can I learn more about the sweet new es6 features that I can use with this tool?
- Here are all the es6 features supported by traceur: https://github.com/google/traceur-compiler/wiki/LanguageFeatures
- Checkout the 'Bonus Round: Promises and Generators' from this article on promises to see how easy new es6 features
it to work with asynchronous code: http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/es6/promises

### What are all the pieces involved?

#### [Traceur]
Transpiles ES6 code into regular ES5 (today's JavaScript) so that it can be run in today's browser.

#### [RequireJS]
RequireJS is used to load libraries which are AMD modules or browser globals, so that they can be concatenated into
a single file.

#### [Assert] library
When `typeAssertions: true` option is used, Traceur generates run-time type assertions such as `assert.type(x, Object)`.
The assert library does the actual run-time check. Of course, you can use your own assert library.

The idea with type assertions is that you only use them during the development/testing and when deploying, you use
`typeAssertions: false`.

#### [Karma]
Test runner that runs the tests in specified browsers, every time you change a file.

#### [Gulp]
Task runner to make defining and running the tasks simpler.


### Metadata and Type Annotation support
Vojta mentions that when developing Angular v2, the angular team is using
some additional features that are not in the ES6 specs.

#### 1/ meta data annotations
```js
class SomeAnnotation {}
class AnotherAnnotation {}

@SomeAnnotation
class Foo {
  constructor(@AnotherAnnotation bar) {}
}
```
This is a very similar syntax to annotations in Java. It is just a nice declarative way to put additional meta data
on classes/functions/parameters.

When `annotations: true`, Traceur transpiles the above code code into something like this:
```js

Foo.annotations = [new SomeAnnotation];
Foo.parameters = [[new AnotherAnnotation]];
```

Therefore you can easily achieve the same thing without transpiling the code. It just won't be as pretty ;-)

#### 2/ type annotations
```js
function request(url: String, data: Object, callback: Function) {
  // ...
}
```

The syntax is more-less the same as [TypeScript].

When `types: true, annotations: true`, Traceur transpiles this code into something like this:
```js
function request(url, data, callback) {
  // ...
}

// this code might change
request.parameters = [[String], [Object], [Function]];
```

When also `typeAssertions: true`, Traceur generates run-time assertions, such as:
```js
function request(url, data, callback) {
  assert.argumentTypes(
    url, String,
    data, Object,
    callback, Function
  );
}
```

### Current Issues

- Sometimes when a breakpoint is set in a source in the chrome developer tools via the source maps, the tab
does not appear for that source from the map.  You have to click on the file name on the right hand side of the
developer tools ui under the section called 'Call Stack'.  It's not a huge issue, but it would be nice to have fixed
at some point.
- Traceur doesn't support minifying the output file when generating source maps, so at present it concatenates all
the es6 code but doesn't minify it.  This will be addressed soon.  Currently gulp doesn't support a minifier which
can preserve an existing source map.  So a grunt plugin and a gulp to grunt bridge may be used in the interim.
- At present, there isn't any tooling which easily can, or perhaps can at all, load amd or browser global modules
from within an es6 module.  As a result, the built output does two http requests, one to get the minified file which
contains legacy amd and browser global modules, and one which gets the minified file which contains es6 modules.  This
isn't a huge deal to do 2 http requests instead of one.
